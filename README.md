# Project-1

In this group project we decided to make a web application that translates speech input in real-time using voice recognition and machine translation technology. The name of our application is speechify, it can transcribe spoken words or phrases into text and then translate that text into whatever langage you choose.

### Getting Started

## Installation

Just a website so a web browser is all your need. I would recommend Google Chrome. You don't need to install anything extra.

## Deployment

This website is deployed on github. So by this link: https://carhoden.github.io/Project-1/
you can access to it.

## Credits

Javascript: Catelin and Connor
HTML & CSS: Brennan and David

## Usage

To use speechify click on the "Start" button to activate the voice recognition, then speak whatever sentences or phrases you wish into the microphone. Upon doing this, the application will automatically transcribe your speech into the text area. Next, you just click the "Translate" button and it will immediately be transcribed into the language of your choice! After translation a modal will popup allowing you to easily share your translated phrase via social media, messaging apps, or copy the link! speechify was built using a web speech API, a Google translate API, JavaScript, and Bulma. The web speech API allows for the users voice to be transcribed to the page, powered by the browser. The google translate API easily translates said text into a language of the users choosing. The JavaScript provides the logic of this application making everything run efficiently. For this application, we used Bulma as our open source framework allowing us to provide the user a sleek but minim
alistic aesthetic that looks great in any screen size!
